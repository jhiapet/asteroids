//Control flow with Boolean
/*

    if/else statements make binary decisions and execute different code based on conditions.
    All conditions are evaluated to be truthy or falsy.
    We can add more conditional statements to if/else statements with else if.
    switch statements make complicated if/else statements easier to read and achieve the same result.
    The ternary operator (?) and a colon (:) allow us to refactor simple if/else statements.
    Comparison operators, including <, >, <=, and >= can compare two variables or values.
    After two values are compared, the conditional statement evaluates to true or false.
    The logical operator && checks if both sides of a condition are truthy.
    The logical operator || checks if either side is truthy.
    The logical operator !== checks if the two sides are not equal.
    An exclamation mark (!) switches the truthiness / falsiness of the value of a variable.
    One equals symbol (=) is used to assign a value to a variable.
    Three equals symbols (===) are used to check if two variables are equal to each other.
